# Tools
### Installing IDE
Across all modules, I'm using [**Eclipse Oxygen**](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
This IDE requires Java SE 6 to be installed on you machine.

##### MacOS
To install, I used **Homebrew**:
> brew cask install java

This command will install the latest version of Java available.
But also you might want to specify the exact version, you can do it like this:

> brew cask install java6

After that, install **Eclipse**:
> brew cask install eclipse-cpp

##### Windows
Coming soon...
##### Linux
Coming soon...

### Setting up IDE and installing extra tools
The set up process is similar for every platform, but _tools' istallation_ process might differ between different OS.

I will install the next tools:
> - gdb - Debugger
> - clang-format - Auto-formatting tool
> - cppstyle - Code stylizer

##### MacOS
